"Uka" is a CG-CA (cybernetic avatar) character model for spoken dialogue systems and avatar communication.  You can open/edit/modify this MMD model under CC-BY 4.0 license.

This CG avatar has been created under [AVATAR SYMBIOTIC SOCIETY Project](https://avatar-ss.org/en/index.html) as an avatar model for [MMDAgent-EX](https://mmdagent-ex.dev/) toolkit.

## Expressions

This model equips +100 morphs for facial expression so that it can express various conversational actions.  Here is an example of pre-defined expressions that can be played by the motion files under `motion` directory.

The ear muffs can be cleared by setting 耳収納 morph to 1.0.  At MMDAgent-EX, issuing command like below will make the muffs disappeared.  ("(model alias)" should be replaced for the target model alias)
